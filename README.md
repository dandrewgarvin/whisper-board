# Whisper Board

This is the open-source whiteboard repo for the DND Campaign `The Path of Whispers`

It is meant to allow the DM to have a very basic grid-based whiteboard map that they can move players and entities around.

This is to enhance the theater of the mind, but to not get in the way of the session.

It is built with Svelte, and includes basic drag-and-drop functionality, as well as socket.io support to broadcast movements.
